# Activities

## Task 1

- Refer to the following link. Discuss how Binary Search Trees work:
  https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BST.html
  answer:DONE in the class

## Task 2

- Refer to the following link.
  https://iq.opengenus.org/time-and-space-complexity-of-binary-search-tree/

Discuss the Time and Space complexity of Binary Search Tree (BST) operations (Searching, Insertion, Deletion) in the Best case, average case and worst case.
the answer:
OPERATION WORST CASE AVERAGE CASE BEST CASE SPACE
Search O(N) O(logN) O(1) O(N)
Insert O(N) O(logN) O(1) O(N)
Delete O(N) O(logN) O(N) O(N)

## Task 3

- Explain how the code in ./src/bst.cpp works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-binary-search-tree-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Refer to te following link. Explain how In-order Traversal is used to print a binary search tree.
  https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/OpenDSA/Books/Everything/html/BinaryTreeTraversal.html#inorder-traversal
  answer: the items are "collected" in the growing order, thus making the traversal In-order.
